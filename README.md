# multi-speakerID baseline
This is python implementation of multi-target speaker recognition based on i-vector feature. This is also baseline system of the first Multi-target speaker detection and identification Challenge Evaluation (MCE 2018, http://www.mce2018.org )


# Dataset
You can download i-vector dataset here

    https://www.kaggle.com/kagglesre/blacklist-speakers-dataset

After download, extract into data folder

# Performance
If you run the code like

    python mce2018_baseline_test.py
    
you will see the performance on top-S and top-1 detector as below :

    Dev set score using train set :
    Top S detector EER is 2.01%
    Top 1 detector EER is 12.26% (Total confusion error is 444)

    Test set score using train set:
    Top S detector EER is 7.52%
    Top 1 detector EER is 16.61% (Total confusion error is 579)

    Test set score using train + dev set:
    Top S detector EER is 6.24%
    Top 1 detector EER is 11.24% (Total confusion error is 369)

And the code also generate example submission file with name "teamname_fixed_primary.csv" and the format are [test utterance ID],[score],[Closest blacklist speaker ID] per each files. For example

    pnah_431154,0.36613864,33762391
    qtxw_470243,0.39585015,60587769
    ....
